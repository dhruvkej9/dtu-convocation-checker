# ✅ COMPLETE SOLUTION - DTU Convocation Checker

## 🎉 Summary

**All issues have been fixed and tested!** The automation is now ready to deploy.

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ SSL Certificate Error (Critical Issue)
**Problem:** `ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID` error preventing access to DTU portal

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# Browser launch with certificate handling
browser = p.chromium.launch(
    headless=True,
    args=['--ignore-certificate-errors', '--ignore-certificate-errors-spki-list']
)

# Context with HTTPS error handling
context = browser.new_context(
    ignore_https_errors=True
)
```

**Status:** ✅ Tested and working

### 2. ✅ Convocation Title Extraction
**Problem:** Need to track when "Convocation 2024" changes to "Convocation 2025"

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# Extract h2 heading from page (e.g., "Convocation 2024")
convocation_title = page.locator('h2').first.inner_text()
result['page_title'] = convocation_title
```

**Status:** ✅ Extracts "Convocation 2024" successfully

### 3. ✅ Multiple Roll Numbers Support
**Already Working:** Code supports checking multiple roll numbers via comma-separated values

**Usage:**
```
ROLL_NUMBERS="2K21/MC/053, 2K21/MC/53"
```

**Status:** ✅ Checks both variations and reports separately

**Fix:**
- Enable Actions in Settings
- Try manual run first

### ❌ Invalid Credentials Error?

**Check:**
1. Name in CAPITALS? ✓
2. Date format dd-mm-yyyy with leading zeros? ✓
3. Roll numbers match portal format? ✓
